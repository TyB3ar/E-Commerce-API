This is my submission for the mini project 'E-Commerce-API' for Module 6. 

This e-commerce-api comes packed with all sorts of amazing routes and functions. 
Some of the features included are: 
- Customer and Customer Account Management:
   - CRUD operations and routes to access and maipulate customer data (name, email, phone number) and account information (username, password) 
   - Connections to orders placed by customers, including a route that details orders placed by certain customers 

- Product Management:
   - CRUD operations to access and manipulate list of products (name and price)

- Order Processing:
   - CRUD operations to access and view orders (customer_id associated with order, products associated with order, order date/shipment date/delivery/date) 
   - Tracking to view date of order placement, view date order will be shipped, and view date order will be delivered
   - Detailed association with products in order, showing name and price of products in order
   - Access to order history of customers, detailing dates and products associated

One note is that my personal 'Password' module was used for testing and development, so a seperate Password module will need to be entered for database access. 

Otherwise, thank you, and enjoy!
